This app was my final individual project in Henry Bootcamp. **[visit now!](https://MyVideogames.app/)**

## Description of the project
Development of Single Page Application (SPA) in which you can see a list of different available video games together with its relevant information. It consumes data from the external api **[rawg](https://rawg.io/apidocs)** and offers the following features :
- Search video games
- Filter / Sort them
- Controlled form to add new video games.

For the filtering and sorting functionalities I was not allowed to use the external API endpoints that already return the filtered or sorted results. In particular, at least one of the ordering or filtering should be accomplished from the frontend. All components had to be created with pure CSS and no external libraries. 
A user may search from any of the available sources: external API or Database, and have the possibility to add a new game to the database.
